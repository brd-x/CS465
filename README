Express is used to create server-side applications that render HTML pages, JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, and SPAs offer a faster and more responsive user experience than traditional server-side applications because they reduce the number of requests to the server.
NoSQL offers better performace and scalability than traditional SQL databases.
JSON is a data format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON provides a way to represent and exchange data, whereas JavaScript provides a way to write scripts and programs that can manipulate data and interact with web pages. JSON ties the front and back end together by acting as the middleman for data transfer and storage.
Throughout the course, we made several changes to models, controllers, and HTML files not only to update their functionality, but also to make them more efficient. Reusable user interface (UI) components provide consistency, maintainibility, and a more clear user experience.
The methods that we used in this program involve GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Endpoints are the URLs that are used to access specific resources or data, such as APIs. We implemented security by having authorization emails and encoded passwords used to edit the backend data.
Despite the struggle I had with the later modules, I learned a lot about HTML, UIs, methods, SQL, JavaScript, and web development in general. I feel much more comfortable with this subject than I was before.
